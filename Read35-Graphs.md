# Reading Notes 35 - Graphs

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of <b> vertices</b> (nodes) connected by line segments named <b>edges</b>

- Vertex: Also named node, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices (nodes).
- Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
- Neighbor - Neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e. are connected via n edge.
- Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

### Overview of the different types of graphs.

1. Undirected - Where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

2. Directed - A graph where every edge is directed.

3. Complete - When all nodes are connected to other nodes.

4. Connected - A graph in which all vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

5. Disconnected - Where some vertices may not have edges.
